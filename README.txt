Frameboot is based on 
Framework 3.x for Drupal 7 created by Andr√© Griffin
http://drupal.org/project/framework

Frameboot, just like Framework is a blank canvas for theme developers, it also takes advantage of
Twitter's fantastic Bootstrap framework.

Use Frameboot as a user friendly starting point to help facilitate your theme development. 
Build site themes without feeling like you have to reinvent the wheel or remove unnecessary code every time.

-------
USAGE

Install to sites/all/themes

Download the Boostrap library and install it within the frameboot folder
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

To fully convert Frameboot to your own custom theme, it is encouraged that you: 
 - COPY the 'frameboot' directory within sites/all/themes/ and rename it as 'yourthemename' 
 - Change the filename and contents of the .info file accordingly and remove all 'packing script' info at the end of the file
 - Use find/replace in template.php to replace 'frameboot' with 'yourthemename' 
 - Upload and enable the theme
 - Modify as needed

To create a sub-theme based on Frameboot, see: http://drupal.org/node/225125
